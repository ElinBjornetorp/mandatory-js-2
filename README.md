**The deadline for this exercise is Friday November 30 08:59**

## Preparation

1. Create a new repository on [Github](github.com) called **mandatory-js-2**

2. Follow the instructions that Github gives you; create a local repository and add a remote or clone
the recently created repository.

## Submission

When you do the submission of your exercise in Ping Pong, **before the deadline**,
you will enter the link to your repository, such as:

```
https://github.com/mygithubusername/mandatory-js-2

## Instructions

Write your own [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game in the browser!
The game should be able to play with 2 players (taking turns on the same computer).
Render the game with HTML and CSS, and implement all functionality of the game with JavaScript. You're required to use jQuery for all the DOM manipulations.
When a game is over, there should be a reset button that allows the players to play a new game.

To get the grade **G** the following needs to be true
* A complete game of tic-tac-toe can be played in the browser between two players (taking turns on the same computer).
* When the game is over, you shouldn't be able to do any more moves.
* When the game is over, you can refresh the game and start a new game (without page refreshing). This should not happen automatically.

### Optional

Try and implement a game AI that you can play against.
